<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* C++ compiler
* CMake

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
   git clone git@github.com:AchrafYndz/graphics-engine.git
```
2. Build the project

#### Executing the Project:

1. Navigate to the `cmake-build-debug` directory by executing the command `cd cmake-build-debug`.
2. Execute the engine binary with an argument that specifies the path to the desired ini file. The command should look like this: `./engine [path_to_ini_file]`.

For example, if you want to run the project with the `3d_fractals001.ini` file, the command would be: `./engine ../ini/3d_fractals/3d_fractals001.ini`.
The resulting image will be generated and saved as `out.bmp` in the current directory.

Alternatively, if you want to process multiple ini files at once, you can use a `filelist`:
1. Change your working directory to the one that contains the `filelist`.
2. Execute the engine binary without any arguments.
The resulting images will be generated and saved with the same name as their ini files.
